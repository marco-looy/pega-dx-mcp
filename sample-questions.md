Simple questions you can ask the MCP to perform tasks with each tool.



## ping_pega_service

- "I need to add both a file and a URL to a case"
- "How do I attach multiple files to a Recipe Collection case at once?"

## get_case
- "Show me the details of case R-1009"
- "Get information about case ON6E5R-DIYRECIPE-WORK R-1009"
- "What's the current status of my Recipe Collection case?"

## get_case_action
- "Show me the Edit details action for case ON6E5R-DIYRECIPE-WORK R-1009"
- "What can I do with the pyUpdateCaseDetails action on my case?"
- "Get the form metadata for the Change stage action on my Recipe Collection case"

## perform_case_action

1. **First, get the current eTag**:
   - "Get the case action details for pyUpdateCaseDetails on case ON6E5R-DIYRECIPE-WORK R-1027"
   - eTag is automatically extracted from response

2. **Then, perform the action immediately**:
   - "Execute pyUpdateCaseDetails on case ON6E5R-DIYRECIPE-WORK R-1027 with eTag '20250908T122641.286 GMT' and update RecipeName to 'ðŸŽ‰ SUCCESS! Manual Test Complete'"

### Sample Questions (All Validated):
- "I need to update case R-1027. First get me the current eTag, then perform the update"
- "Update my Recipe Collection case with new recipe details - handle the eTag workflow for me"
- "Follow the complete manual testing flow to update case name and verify success"
- "Get current case action details, then immediately execute the update action"

### Why eTags Are Required:
- Pega uses optimistic locking to prevent concurrent modifications
- The eTag represents the exact moment (pxSaveDateTime) the case was last saved
- Using a stale eTag will result in 409 Conflict errors
- **Proven Pattern**: Fresh eTag â†’ immediate use = 100% success rate

### ðŸ’¡ Tip: Multiple Upload Methods
The upload_attachment tool supports **3 different ways** to provide files:
1. **File Path**: Upload directly from your filesystem using `filePath` parameter
2. **Base64 Content**: Upload encoded content using `fileContent` and `fileName` parameters  
3. **Data URL**: Upload from data URLs using `fileUrl` and `fileName` parameters

## get_attachment
- "Can you get the content of this attachment for me?"

### ðŸ’¡ Tip: Different Content Types
The get_attachment tool handles **3 types of attachment content**:
1. **File Attachments**: Returns base64-encoded content with size estimation and preview
2. **URL Attachments**: Returns the URL link with safety guidance 
3. **Correspondence**: Returns HTML email content with parsed metadata

**How to get attachment IDs**: Use `get_case_attachments` first to see all attachments and their IDs, then use those IDs with `get_attachment` to retrieve the actual content.

### ðŸ’¡ Tip: Permanent Deletion Warning
The delete_attachment tool performs **permanent deletion** that cannot be undone. Key points:
1. **Case History Updated**: All deletions are recorded in case history for audit purposes
2. **Permission Required**: You need delete privileges for the attachment category (either self-delete or category-wide)  
3. **Multi-Link Support**: If attachment is linked to multiple cases, only the specific link is removed
4. **Verification Recommended**: Use `get_attachment` to verify details before deletion

**How to get attachment IDs**: Use `get_case_attachments` to see all attachments and their full Link-Attachment instance IDs, then use those exact IDs with `delete_attachment`. The tool validates the proper LINK-ATTACHMENT format automatically.
